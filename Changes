Revision history for PostgreSQL extension explanation.

0.4.0
      - Fixed the `Makefile` so that the documentation file should properly be
        found and installed by `PGXS`.
      - Fixed the Makefile to recognize the `PG_CONFIG` environment variable.
      - Fixed the Makefile to confirm to pgsql-hackers recommendations.
      - Changed the Makefile to read the distribution name and version from
        META.json.

0.3.0   2011-04-30T00:12:09
      - Fixed GitHub links in `META.json`.
      - Added abstract to the `provides` section of `META.json`.
      - Fixed the Markdown formattin of `psql` output in the documentation so
        that the results properly appear in a `<pre>` block.
      - Enabled the `VERBOSE` parameter to the internal call to `EXPLAIN`.
        This populates a few more columns that were otherwise always `NULL`,

        ANALYZE`. This populates a few more columns that were otherwise always
        `NULL`, namely those ending in `_blocks`.

        from an unpackaged install via `CREATE EXTENSION semver FROM
        unpackaged`.
