explanation 0.3.0
=================

This extension adds a new function, `explanation()`, to your database. Pass it
a string that executes a query and the function runs `EXPLAIN` on the query
and returns the results as a table. Each node in the plan is represented by a
single row, and child nodes refer to the unique identifier of their parents.
The results, that is, are organized into a proximity tree.

Installation
------------

To build it, just do this:

    make
    make installcheck
    make install

If you encounter an error such as:

    "Makefile", line 8: Need an operator

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
`gmake`:

    gmake
    gmake installcheck
    gmake install

If you encounter an error such as:

    make: pg_config: Command not found

Be sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:

    env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make && make installcheck && make install

If you encounter an error such as:

    ERROR:  must be owner of database regression

You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:

    make installcheck PGUSER=postgres

Dependencies
------------
The `explanation` extension requires PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher compiled with
XML support (`--with-xml`).
